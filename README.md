## 📘 Folder Details

### ⚙️ CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
Implementations of classical CPU scheduling algorithms such as:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
  
Each program is written in **C++** with clear comments and test cases.

---

### 🔗 Graph Algorithms
A collection of graph-based algorithms and techniques:
- BFS, DFS
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford
- Floyd-Warshall
- Kruskal’s & Prim’s Algorithm
- Topological Sorting
- Graph Coloring

Includes both **directed** and **undirected** graph examples.

---

### 🧩 Problem Solving
Solutions to various online judge problems to improve logic and coding efficiency.

#### CodeForces/
Contains my solutions to CodeForces contests and practice problems.

#### LeetCode/
Organized by difficulty:
- `Easy/` → Beginner-level problems for warm-up  
- `Medium/` → Intermediate challenges with algorithmic thinking  
- `Hard/` → Advanced problems that require optimization and creative problem-solving

---

### 🏆 Programming Contest (CPP)
Dedicated to **competitive programming** solutions written in C++.

#### LeetCode/
Focused on solving LeetCode problems in a contest environment (timed runs).

#### vJudge/
Contains submissions and practice problems from **vJudge contests**.

---

### 🧰 STL (Standard Template Library)
Tutorials, examples, and mini-projects demonstrating:
- Vectors, Sets, Maps, Queues, Stacks
- Iterators, Pairs, Tuples
- Algorithms (`sort()`, `find()`, `count()`, etc.)
- Custom comparators and lambda functions

Goal: Mastering efficient coding using STL in real-world problem-solving.
